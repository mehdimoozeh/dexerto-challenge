### Error Handling:
- [ ] The application should handle potential errors gracefully, returning appropriate status codes and messages.
### Documentation:
- [ ] Provide clear and concise documentation on how to install and run the application locally in the README file of the GitHub repository.
### Bonus Points:
#### Security:
- [x] Implement basic security measures such as rate limiting and input validation.
#### Testing:
- [ ] Write tests for your resolvers using Jest, Cypress, or another testing framework of your choice.
#### Authentication:
